## Abstract

In this paper, we estimated a regression model to see if being black or not influences the salaries of NBA players. 

The model focused on players' position, years as a professional player, players being black or not, players being married or not, players that are black and married, and minutes played per season. 

These variables have been used to predict the annual salary of NBA players in thousands of dollars
